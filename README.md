# Pomodoro Project

This is a project to assist in concentration while learning. Based on the **Pomodoro Tehinque** developed by __Francesco Cirillo__ in the late 1980s. 
The **Pomodoro Technique** allows you to work in focused 25min interval and take a short 5 mins break. Once you are done with four rounds of focused work, you can then take a long break of 300mins. You can read more about the Pomodoro Technique by clicking [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

This project is built to do exactly just that. To follow the pomodoro technique. Making use of Python GUI, I added a tomato as the background  and created some functions to cater for the start_timer, the reset_timer and the actual countdown mechanism (using tkinter's builtin window.after function).

It displays a checkmark for every work instance completed allowing you to know the number of worksessions completed. 

To upgrade it would be to include an alert (add a sound) to indicate the end of each session. Still a work in progress.
